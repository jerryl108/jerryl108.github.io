Other info:

* I minored in psychology so that I could better understand and help people. I find the human mind and brain fascinating. I'm excited by the potential for technologies to improve people's health and well being as well as help people function whose functioning is impaired.
* I take pride in guiding and teaching people if they don't have an understanding of a concept that I have experience with. Likewise, I hope to not let my pride get in the way of learning from others. There's no shame in different people's knowledge and experiences being different.
* I love spicy food.
